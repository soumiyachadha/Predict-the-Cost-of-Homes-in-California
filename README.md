# Predict-the-Cost-of-Homes-in-California
This notebook trains a machine learning model that predicts home costs in California

The overall objective was to predict the value of home prices using 9 feature variables and 1 target variable:

Feature Variables
longitude: A measure of how far west a house is (a higher value is farther west)
latitude: A measure of how far north a house is (a higher value is farther north)
housingMedianAge: Median age of a house within a block (a lower number is a newer building)
totalRooms: Total number of rooms within a block
totalBedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a block
population: Total number of people residing within a block
households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block
medianIncome: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)
oceanProximity: Location of the house in proximity to the ocean


Target Variable
medianHouseValue: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)

CONCLUSION:
The project successfully developed a machine learning model to predict home prices in California with reasonable accuracy. The process highlighted the importance of thorough data preprocessing, rigorous model evaluation, and the need for continuous improvement. While the model showed some overfitting, the insights gained provide a strong foundation for further refinement and potential deployment.
